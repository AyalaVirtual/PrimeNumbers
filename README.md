# PrimeNumbers


A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all prime numbers, but 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not.

Your prime directive: Build a PrimeDirective.java program that creates an ArrayList of all prime numbers in an array.
